This tutorial will give you the fundamental of reactive programming before we jump into the two most famous reactive programming SDK in iOS, which are 
RxSwift
https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift
ReactiveCocoa
https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa

In this demo project, I will explain the basic concept of reactive and help you get ready for the RxSwift that I start teaching soon.
